# AboutMe
In lab03, I added another 2 questions, the first question asks the user to guess a number (birthday date) with 4 trails, the second question has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array, the user is given 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.

When the user answers all questions, his score will be displayed.
