                I applied in Luminus Technical university college for a software engineering diploma, to pursue my
                passion for web developing. Being in a fast-paced environment where I was able to gain an in-depth
                knowledge on the programming field through an improvement process, which really solidified for me that
                software engineering was the right career path for me. I love companies that focus on leaving a small
                environmental footprint.
